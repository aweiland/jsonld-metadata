     *       about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,
     *       while mainEntity should be used for only the primary one. Second, some pages have a primary entity that itself
     *       describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
     *       Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
     *       should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product.
