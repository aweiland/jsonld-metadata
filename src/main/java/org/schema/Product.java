      Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For
      example a restaurant's home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
      represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship

      to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property

      mainEntityOfPage might be used on pages within various retailers’ sites giving details for the same product.

      about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,

      describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
      Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
      should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product.
