/**
 * Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).

    /**
     * Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described.
      <br /><br />
      Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For
      example a restaurant's home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
      represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship
      between the page and the primary entity.
      <br /><br />

      Related properties include sameAs, about, and url.
      <br /><br />

      The sameAs and url properties are both similar to mainEntityOfPage. The url property should be reserved to refer to more
      official or authoritative web pages, such as the item’s official website. The sameAs property also relates a thing
      to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property
      serves more to clarify which of several entities is the main one for that page.
      <br /><br />

      mainEntityOfPage can be used for any page, including those not recognized as authoritative for that entity. For example,
      for a product, sameAs might refer to a page on the manufacturer’s official site with specs for the product, while
      mainEntityOfPage might be used on pages within various retailers’ sites giving details for the same product.
      <br /><br />

      about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,
      while mainEntity should be used for only the primary one. Second, some pages have a primary entity that itself
      describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
      Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
      should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product.
