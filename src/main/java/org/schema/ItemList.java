      example a restaurant's home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
      represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship

      to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property

      about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics,

      describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
      Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
